Barrels and Backpacks
by Preston Anderson
This is intended to be the backend code for the inventory systems, however eventually I will 
make this visual and forego the whole console situation. 
Please excuse the jank! It'll be better I swear!
Initially I had planned for the whole loop of the project to be different by going through 
different steps of adding, removing, and moving items through each inventory,
but I found it easier (and through explanation by you, mr winnika) to make it a menu for your options instead.

For the ItemIDs, they are as follows:

ItemID 1 Name = "Wooden Sword"
ItemID 2 Name = "Health Potion"
ItemID 3 Name = "Wooden Round Shield"
ItemID 4 Name = "Gold Coin"
ItemID 5 Name = "Leather Armor"

Two main errors are if you don't have the required amount of items in the barrel or backpack
when you are moving it between inventories, it breaks the entire code,
and also you can only add 1 item at a time with no cap to the items currently.
This is what I plan to fix next opportunity I get, however in the state that the project is in now,
I believe that it is perfect as is for a "rough draft" of sorts.

Thank you for your assistance and for the fun project, I look forward to finishing this next semester :]
