Barrels and Backpacks
by Preston Anderson
This is intended to be the backend code for the inventory systems, however eventually I will 
make this visual and forego the whole console situation. 
Please excuse the jank! It'll be better I swear!
Initially I had planned for the whole loop of the project to be different by going through 
different steps of adding, removing, and moving items through each inventory,
but I found it easier (and through explanation by you, mr winnika) to make it a menu for your options instead.

For the ItemIDs, they are as follows:

ItemID 1 Name = "Wooden Sword"
ItemID 2 Name = "Health Potion"
ItemID 3 Name = "Wooden Round Shield"
ItemID 4 Name = "Gold Coin"
ItemID 5 Name = "Leather Armor"

Thank you for your assistance and for the fun project, I look forward to finishing this next semester :]
